Here is a Ransomware script written in Bash. This is very, very dangerous and must not be used illegally against anyone without explicit permission. The file bash script first
looks at all the files in the current directory. Then once it finds its targets it stores them in an array then for every file in the array we tell bash to encrypt it using openssl
encryption.
